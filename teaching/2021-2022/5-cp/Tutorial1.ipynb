    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraint Programming is a rich declarative approach to solve combinatorial problems. This approach has been used to solve diverse real word applications such as scheduling, timetabling, planning, routing, supply chain, clustreing, data mining, classification, etc. See for instance https://www.a4cp.org/node/1281.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Constraint programming can be used to solve decision or optimisation problems. In both families, a problem must be stated as : \n",
    "- A set of variables (the unkown of the problem). Each variable $x$ is associated to a set of values $D(x)$ that is called to domain of $x$. The latter represents the possible values that $x$ can take. We will be using mostly integer finite variables. That is, a type of variables whose domain is a finite subset of  $\\mathbb{Z}$\n",
    "- A set of constraints. Each constraint restrics the possible combinantion of values allowed by the different varialbes in the scope of the constraint. For instance, the constraint $x<y$ restrics the value assigned to x to be less than the value assigned to y\n",
    "\n",
    "A constraint can be seen as a (sub-)problem itself. In that sence, a problem can be defined as a conjunction of smaller problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a decision problem, for each variable $x$, the task is to assign a value from $\\cal D(x)$ to $x$ such that every constraint is satisfied. In an opptimisation problem, the purpose is exactly the same, however, among all the possible solutions, we look for one that minimises or maximizes an objective function. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working on both decision and optimition problems. Throughout these tutorials, we focus on the modelling aspect of constraint programming along with a solid understanding of what is happening within a solver. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We find many constraint solvers in the literature that are developped by both acamemics (for instance http://www.choco-solver.org/, miniCP http://www.minicp.org/, and GeCode https://www.gecode.org/) and industrials (for instance Google OR Tools https://developers.google.com/optimization and IBM ILOG CPLEX CP Optimizer https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio). \n",

    "For an up-to-date list of solvers, you can have a look at the following two annual solver competitions: \n",
